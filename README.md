How to Implement A/B Testing in Ruby with ConfigCat Feature Flags and Amplitude Data Analytics Platform

## Setup

Here we're going to use a simple framework called Sinatra to create a simple landing page with a blue colored Call to action button. We will use ConfigCat to change the color of the button to red and track the conversion rate of the two variants with Amplitude.

## Run the app

```sh
ruby landing_page.rb
```
